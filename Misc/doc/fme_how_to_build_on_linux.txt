How to build the FME on Linux
=============================

0. Prerequisites
----------------

I used CentOS 6 (upgraded). I didn't use the OpenJDK version which was preinstalled. So first thing I did was:

yum remove java-*

On a 64 bit system I need to have 32-bit support:

yum install glibc.i386

I had the following versions:

[ml@shroom ~]$ perl -v
This is perl, v5.10.1 (*) built for x86_64-linux-thread-multi


1. Install JDK and perl modules:
--------------------------------

Download and install the latest JDK. I got the JDK from here:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/

Make sure java and javac are in the PATH. I had:

[ml@shroom ~]$ javac -version
javac 1.8.0_05
[ml@shroom ~]$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_05"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_05-b13)

Download required PERL modules via CPAN. You might have to install cpan first

yum install cpan

After that this should install the required libraries:

cpan install Bit::Vector
cpan install Set::IntRange
(A bit messy but it got there eventually)


2. Install ant
--------------

Get the latest binary distribution here:
http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

Make sure ant is also in your PATH. I had:

[ml@shroom ~]$ ant -version
Apache Ant(TM) version 1.9.4 compiled on April 29 2014


3. Checkout the source from github
----------------------------------
Checkout the source from https://github.com/krotik/fme

You can use SVN to checkout github sources if you don't like git. This checks out the latest source into the current directory:

svn checkout https://github.com/krotik/fme/trunk .


4. Build the FME distribution version
-------------------------------------

In the checkout go to <checkout root>/Workspace/Fme and run:

ant assemble

after that there should be a working distribution in <checkout root>/Build.
