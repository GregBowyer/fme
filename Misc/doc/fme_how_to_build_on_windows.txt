How to build the FME on Windows
===============================

1. Install JDK:
--------------

Download and install the latest JDK. I got the JDK from here:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/

Make sure java and javac are in the PATH. I had:

[ml@shroom ~]$ javac -version
javac 1.8.0_05
[ml@shroom ~]$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_05"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_05-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.5-b02, mixed mode)

C:\Users\ml>javac -version
javac 1.8.0_05

C:\Users\ml>java -version
java version "1.8.0_05"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_05-b13)

You don't need to install perl since the FME for windows comes already with Strawberry Perl. 

2. Install ant
--------------

Get the latest binary distribution here:
http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

Make sure ant is also in your PATH. I had:

C:\Users\ml>ant -version
Apache Ant(TM) version 1.9.4 compiled on April 29 2014

3. Checkout the source from github
----------------------------------
Checkout the source from https://github.com/krotik/fme

You can use SVN to checkout github sources if you don't like git. This checks out the latest source into the current directory:

svn checkout https://github.com/krotik/fme/trunk .


4. Build the FME distribution version
-------------------------------------

To extract Strawberry Perl go to <checkout root>/Workspace/Fme and run (if you just want to assemble a version you don't need to do this):

env.bat

in the same directory run then:

ant assemble

after that there should be a working distribution in <checkout root>/Build.
